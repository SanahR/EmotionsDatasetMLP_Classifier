# Results
To create this page, I ran the program 3 times, and then I pasted the results here. Hopefully, this gives you a more complete picture of what the program does. While I did initially run it with verbose on, I decided to spare both of us the time by cutting out the unnecessary parts.

Since the emotions dataset is based off of semi-ambiguous tweets, there are several times when the classifiers can't detect sarcasm or irony, which definitely contributes to the low 80s barrier that neither of them can break through in terms of accuracy.
